# SMTP Notifier Plugin for Scrypted

The SMTP Notifier Plugin allows you to send Scrypted notifications as emails, using SMTP. If a media resource is included in the Scrypted notification settings, this plugin will convert it to an image and add it to the email as an attachment.

When using a public SMTP server, check the documentation of the server for authentication requirements. For example, Gmail may require authenticating with an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).
